	<p>According to an article written by (Logan Vandermark, 2023), An essential daily task of livestock producers is ensuring that animals have access to water. This often requires frequent checking of water tanks to make sure they are free of  ice and filling properly. Depending on the location of animals relative to the producer’s home, checking water tanks can require hours of labor and significant fuel costs for remote pastures. Research has indicated that livestock producers may spend over $1,500 a year on fuel checking water sources. Numerous issues can occur that prevent animals from accessing water, including equipment failure and tanks freezing over. The consequences of livestock not having access to water can be severe, ranging from animals escaping from pasture boundaries in search of a water source to declines in animal performance and death, potentially costing tens of thousands of dollars. Checking stock tanks, tire tanks, or stock dams in person on a daily basis is not always an option. Through the use of water monitoring systems and other pieces of technology, you can check the status of the water source remotely throughout the day.</p>
	<p>According to (Logan Vandermark, 2023), Cellular based trail cameras can serve as a cost-effective option to remotely view your stock tanks. One of the greatest advantages this can serve is providing visual confirmation of available water. These cameras can also be set up to send you a picture at regular schedules, such as during the morning and evening. These are also quick and easy to install and take down, providing greater flexibility than other monitoring systems for water sources. One consideration to make is whether you have strong cellular service reception at the watering location, which is required to transmit images. The big question with implementing any technology on ranch is, “Does this make sense (or cents) on my operation?” This technology depends upon the user to learn how to use it and trust that it is monitoring the water source accurately. In many cases water monitoring systems will provide added value to most operations through either time saved checking water sources or fuel savings. Before purchasing a unit, several factors should be considered to find the right system for your operation, including: 1) cellular connectivity 2) monthly or yearly subscription fees, and 3) the ability to mount units in a location where cattle can’t rub or scratch them.</p>
	<p>Summary:</p>
	<p>This project explored the design and development of a Water Monitoring System for Livestock that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology using cameras to check the water levels in tanks.  While the current design(Water Monitoring system for farms) focuses on core functionalities like real-time water level monitoring and automated refilling, the potential exists for future enhancements that could rival the functionalities discussed in this literature review.</p>

	<p>According to (Yash Panchal, 2023), In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a smart dustbin that utilizes an Arduino micro-controller to control a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor. The purpose of the dustbin is to improve waste management by providing a convenient and efficient way to dispose of garbage. The smart dustbin operates by detecting the presence of an object using the ultrasonic sensor. When an object is detected, the servo motor opens the lid of the dustbin, allowing the user to dispose of their waste. Once the waste is deposited, the servo motor closes the lid, ensuring that the dustbin remains closed and odor-free. The design of the smart dustbin is simple and easy to assemble, making it an ideal solution for households and public spaces. The Arduino micro-controller is used to control the servo motor and the ultrasonic sensor, allowing for precise and accurate detection of objects. The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on the lid of the dustbin, providing a wide detection range. The smart dustbin can be powered using a battery or an external power source, making it flexible and easy to install. The Arduino micro-controller is programmed using the Arduino IDE, making it easy for anyone to modify or update the software to suit their specific needs. Overall, the smart dustbin presented in this paper provides a practical and effective solution to waste management. It is easy to use, easy to install, and can be customized to suit a wide range of applications. With its ability to detect objects using an ultrasonic sensor and control a servo motor, the smart dustbin represents a significant advancement in waste management technology.</p>
	<p>Summary:</p>
	<p>This paper describes the design and implementation of a smart dustbin for improved waste management. The system leverages an Arduino microcontroller to control a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor. Function: The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of an object (user approaching), Upon detection, the servo motor opens the lid for waste disposal. Once the object is removed, the servo motor closes the lid, ensuring it remains closed and odor-free.</p>
	<p>The core functionalities of the smart dustbin (Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor) can be adapted for use in a Water Monitoring System for Farms.  In this application: The ultrasonic sensor would be positioned near the water trough.Upon detecting an animal's presence (replacing the object in the smart dustbin), the servo motor could be programmed to perform a new action: dispensing a controlled amount of salt lick.This approach offers the potential benefit of automated salt lick distribution based on animal presence, promoting efficient utilization and ensuring animals receive essential minerals.</p>
